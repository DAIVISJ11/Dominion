     Solar System
    </H1>
    <p>The solar system is one of those topics that never stops being awe‑inspiring, and the latest information paints a vivid picture of our cosmic neighbourhood. Fresh sources describe it as a gravitationally bound system centred on the Sun, containing eight planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and countless smaller bodies.

🌞 What the Solar System Is
A gravitationally bound system around the Sun: Everything orbits our star due to its immense mass.

A diverse collection of worlds: Eight major planets, over 200 moons, and millions of smaller objects like asteroids and comets.

A tiny part of the Milky Way: Located in the Orion Spur of our galaxy.

    <p id="Sun" style="text-align: center;">
        The Sun is one of those topics that looks simple on the surface but becomes wildly fascinating the moment you zoom in. Since you asked about the sun, here’s a crisp, engaging overview grounded in the latest information from NASA and other authoritative sources.☀️ What the Sun Actually Is The Sun is a 4.5‑billion‑year‑old yellow dwarf star made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It sits at the center of our solar system, holding everything—from planets to comets—in orbit with its immense gravityScience Mission Directorate.

🔥 How Hot It Really Gets
Surface temperature: about 5,973°C

Core temperature: around 15 million°C, hot enough for nuclear fusion, the process that powers the Sun

Fusion is what creates the outward pressure that keeps the Sun from collapsing under its own gravity.

🌍 Why It Matters for Earth
It provides all the energy that makes life possible.

It drives weather, climate, and photosynthesis.

Without it, Earth would be a frozen, airless rock.

📏 Size and Scale
The Sun is 109 times wider than Earth.

It contains 99.86% of all the mass in the solar system.

You could fit about 1.3 million Earths inside it.

🌀 Motion and Behavior
It rotates once every 25 days at the equator and 34 days at the poles.

It orbits the Milky Way every 225–250 million years.

It produces solar flares and sunspots—dramatic magnetic events that can affect satellites and power grids.

🪐 What Pluto Actually Is
Pluto is officially classified as a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a distant region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. The International Astronomical Union reclassified it in 2006 because it’s small, icy, and doesn’t fully clear its orbit of other objects.

🌌 Key Facts About Pluto
Dwarf planet status — Pluto is no longer considered a major planet because it doesn’t dominate its orbital zone.

Highly eccentric orbit — Its path around the Sun is stretched and tilted, taking about 248 Earth years to complete one revolution.

Icy, varied surface — New Horizons images show nitrogen ice plains, rugged mountains, and that famous heart-shaped region.

Cold and distant world — Temperatures plunge to around –230°C, and sunlight is faint at that distance.

Five known moons — Including Charon, which is so large relative to Pluto that they’re sometimes called a double dwarf-planet system.

🔭 Why People Still Love Pluto
There’s something irresistible about an underdog world on the edge of the Solar System. It’s tiny, strange, and scientifically rich — and it captured the world’s imagination when New Horizons sent back those stunning close-ups.

        It looks like you’re asking about Haumea, a real dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt — the name “HamehHameh” is very close, so I’m guessing that’s what you meant. If you did mean something different, just tell me and I’ll adjust.

🌑 Haumea: the fast‑spinning, football‑shaped dwarf planet
Haumea is one of the most unusual objects in the outer solar system. It’s elongated like a rugby ball because it spins incredibly fast — completing one rotation in about 4 hours, one of the fastest of any large body in the solar system.

Key features
Location in the Kuiper Belt: Haumea orbits beyond Neptune, in the same region as Pluto.

Extreme shape: Its rapid rotation stretches it into an ellipsoid rather than a sphere.

Two moons: Hiʻiaka and Namaka orbit Haumea, discovered in the mid‑2000s.

A ring system: Haumea is one of the few known objects beyond Saturn to have a ring.

Hawaiian namesake: It’s named after the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth and fertility.

🌑 What Ceres Is
Ceres is a dwarf planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. It was discovered in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi and later reclassified from asteroid to dwarf planet because of its size and spherical shape.

🧊 Key Features of Ceres
Largest body in the asteroid belt: It makes up about 25% of the belt’s total mass.

Salty subsurface ocean remnants: Evidence from NASA’s Dawn mission suggests briny water still exists underground and sometimes reaches the surface.

Bright surface spots: These famous “faculae” are salt deposits, especially in Occator Crater.

Fast rotation: A day on Ceres lasts about 9 hours.

Mild potential for life: Not Earth-like life, but the chemistry and water make it scientifically intriguing.

📏 Basic Stats
Feature	Value
Diameter	~940 km (about 1/3 the size of the Moon)
Orbit	2.77 AU from the Sun; 4.6-year orbital period
Surface	Rocky, dusty, with salt deposits and impact craters

    <p style="text-align: center;">
Hygiea is a fascinating object — and it sits right on the boundary between asteroid and dwarf planet. Fresh observations give us a surprisingly complete picture of what it is and why astronomers debate its status.

🌑 What Hygiea Is
Hygiea is the fourth‑largest object in the asteroid belt and one of the roundest bodies there. It orbits between Mars and Jupiter and was discovered in 1849.

🪐 Why Some Call It a “Planet”
In 2019, high‑resolution images from the Very Large Telescope showed that Hygiea is nearly spherical, which means it meets one of the key requirements for being a dwarf planet.
Some researchers now argue it should be classified as one, making it the smallest known dwarf planet.

NASA’s JPL, however, still lists it as a main‑belt asteroid, not officially a dwarf planet.

📌 Key Facts About Hygiea
Diameter ~407–450 km — roughly the size of the U.S. state of Iowa

Orbits the Sun every ~5.56 years

Rotation period ~13.8 hours

Carbon‑rich C‑type composition — dark, primitive material

Likely formed from a massive collision about 2 billion years ago

Extremely round shape — unusual for an asteroid
